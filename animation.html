		My work has been influenced by the movie American Psycho where in one scene, the main character dances to his favorite music prior to murdering someone. Thinking about my characterâ€™s main characteristic which is luring people in order for him to harvest emotions out of them, led me to the decision to show a moment where he simply enjoys some music before using his special ability. In order to deliver this vision, I took a video of myself dancing, with my laptop camera and made a short 2D animation using the rotoscoping technique on the Photoshop software. I have also employed the skills I have learned for audio in class to complete the sound effects in this project. In my final project, my main character slowly appears and we see him dancing to a calm jazz music in the background. We also see a text balloon that expresses his thoughts and most importantly, we see the emotion harvest happen at last. I have used royalty free music for the background music and for the inhaling sound for when he harvests the emotions, I recorded myself with the recording app on my iphone and added it. I have also added some fade in and out transitions for a smoother flow.
