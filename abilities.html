	<p>When he becomes becomes his alter being, he is utterly difficult to find. He appears once in a blue moon at night times and the locations he appears have no consistency. He is special because he is capable of harvesting emotions out of people, enabling them to feel numb. Thus, people who severely suffer emotionally and mentally find him to become emotionless. When the amount of people who come to him to request emotion elimination is insufficient, he will lure the vulnerable ones with his charms to fullfill his need for emotions. At night, he flies with his black feather wings. He also suffers certain symptoms if he does not constantly consume emotions such as running out of breath and not being able to go back to his human form. Though, from harvesting emotions from others he also gives people lessons to appreciate and accept emotions whether they are bad or good since after they live emotionless for a while, they realize the importance of emotions.
